Prolog Project

The Prolog Project had students write several different mini functions in which helped student grasp the fundamentals of prolog. These mini functions include:

	   1) isSet(S) - A function in which takes a list (S) and determines if the list is a set and contains no duplicate values.
	   2) subset(A, S) - A function in which takes in two lists (A, S) and determines if the list A is a subset of S. 
	   3) union(A, B, C) - A function in which takes in two list (A, B) and returns a list (C) in which contain the values in which are in both list A and B with no duplicates. 
	   4) intersection(A, B, C) - A function in which takes in two list (A, B) and returns a list (C) in which contain the values in which are only in both list A and B.
	   5) tally(E, L, N) - A function in which takes in a list (L) and a value (E) and returns a value (N) of the total number of times E is in L.
	   6) subst(X Y, L, F) - A function in which takes in a list (L) and two values (X, Y) and returns a list (F) which is identical to L; however, whenever the element X shows up it is replaced with the element Y. 
	   7) insert(X, L, F) - A function in which takes a list (L) and a value (X) and returns a list (F) which is identical to L; however, F also contains the value X and F should be sorted from smallest to greatest. 
	   8) flatten(A, B) - A function in which takes a list (A), A may or may not contain sublists within itself, and returns a list (B) with no sublists at all, just one long list.

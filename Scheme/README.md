Scheme Project 

The Scheme Project had students write several different mini functions in which helped student grasp the fundamentals of scheme. These mini functions include:
	  
	  1) (Subst x y L) - A function in which takes a list (L) and two different values (x, y)  and returns an identical 
	  list to L; however, with every occurence of x has been replaced with y.
	  2) (all-different? L) - A function in which takes a list (L) and deteremines if every value in the list is 
	  different.
	  3) (n-nodes T) - A function in which takes a binary tree (T) and returns the total number of nodes contained in the
	  tree.
	  4) (n-leaves T) - A function in which takes a binary tree (T) and returns the total number of leaves contained in 
	  the tree.
	  5) (height T) - A function in which takes a binary tree (T) and returns the height of the tree. 
	  6) (postorder T) - A function in which takes a binary tree (T) and prints out the value of each node in postorder.
	  7) (flatten L) - A function in which takes in a list (L), L may or may not contain sublists within itself, and 
	  returns a list with no sublists at all, just one long list.
	  8) (member-bst? V T) - A function in which takes a binary search tree (T) along with a value (V) and determines if 
	  the value (V) in a member of the binary search tree.
